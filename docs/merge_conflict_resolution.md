# Merge Conflict Resolution Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the standard procedures for resolving merge conflicts in the codebase, based on recent resolutions and best practices.

## General Guidelines
1. Always review both versions of conflicting code before resolving
2. Keep the more complete implementation when it adds functionality without breaking existing features
3. Maintain consistent code style across resolutions
4. Document significant merge decisions in this file

## Recent Resolutions

### Base Resource Classes (2025-02-03)
The following files were resolved with conflicts:

1. `XotBaseResource.php`:
   - Resolved by keeping clean syntax without extra semicolons
   - Maintained consistent code style with PHP PSR standards

2. `XotBaseCreateRecord.php` and `XotBaseEditRecord.php`:
   - Kept the more complete implementation from dev branch
   - Retained form schema methods and proper type hints
   - Maintained consistent method organization
   - Preserved important form configuration options in comments

### Activity Module (2025-02-03)
1. `ActivityResource.php`:
   - Kept complete implementation with proper form schema
   - Organized imports for better readability
   - Maintained comprehensive class documentation

2. `ListActivities.php`:
   - Resolved conflicts in table columns configuration
   - Kept comprehensive implementation with proper labels and sorting
   - Maintained consistent code style with other list pages
   - Preserved all necessary column definitions

3. `BaseActivity.php`:
   - Resolved nested merge conflicts
   - Kept strict_types declaration
   - Maintained proper class documentation
   - Used consistent code style

4. `Snapshot.php`:
   - Removed commented out code
   - Kept clean implementation
   - Maintained proper type hints

### User Module Language Files (2025-02-03)
1. All language files in `Modules/User/lang/it/`:
   - Kept strict_types declarations
   - Maintained consistent file structure
   - Preserved proper type safety

### Notify Module (2025-02-03)
1. `NotificationResource.php`:
   - Combined necessary imports from both branches
   - Kept XotBaseResource inheritance
   - Maintained complete form schema implementation

### TechPlanner Module (2025-02-03)
1. Rimossi file `.old` obsoleti:
   - `LegalOfficeResource/ListRecords.old`
   - `MedicalDirectorResource/ListRecords.old`
   - `LegalRepresentativeResource/ListRecords.old`
   - Questi file sono stati sostituiti da implementazioni pi√π recenti che seguono il pattern XotBaseListRecords

### Correzioni (2025-02-03)
1. `ListSnapshots.php`:
   - Corretto errore nella colonna state dove la variabile $view non era definita
   - Aggiunto il percorso corretto della view: 'activity::filament.tables.columns.state'

## Best Practices
1. Always keep proper PHP type hints and docblocks
2. Maintain consistent method organization
3. Preserve important configuration options, even if commented
4. Follow PSR coding standards
5. Document significant architectural decisions

## Conflict Prevention
1. Coordinate with team members when working on base classes
2. Keep feature branches up to date with main branch
3. Make smaller, focused commits
4. Document API changes proactively
