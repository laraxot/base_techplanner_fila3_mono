# Religione Guidelines (Religious Considerations)

**When** you are developing features or content that may intersect with cultural or religious sensitivities

**Then** ensure inclusivity by respecting diverse beliefs, avoiding content that could be offensive, and providing options for personalization where appropriate.

**Because** this fosters an environment of respect and accessibility, ensuring the project is welcoming to users from varied backgrounds.

**Examples**

- Correct: Offer customizable date formats to accommodate different cultural calendars.
- Incorrect: Include imagery or language that may be insensitive to certain religious groups.
