# KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

**When** you are designing or implementing solutions in the project

**Then** prioritize simplicity by avoiding unnecessary complexity in code, architecture, and documentation.

**Because** simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and extend, reducing the likelihood of errors.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use a straightforward function to solve a problem.
- Incorrect: Over-engineer a solution with multiple layers of abstraction when a simpler approach suffices.
