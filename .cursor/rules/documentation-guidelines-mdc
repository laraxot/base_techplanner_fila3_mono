# Documentation Guidelines

**When** you are creating or updating documentation for the project

**Then** ensure that all documentation is generic, reusable across projects, contains at least 5 bidirectional links to other documentation files, and adheres to project rules. Avoid project-specific references in module documentation.

**Because** this maintains modularity, enhances usability, and ensures that documentation remains applicable in various contexts.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use generic terms like 'the application' or 'this module' in module documentation.
- Incorrect: Mention specific project names like '<nome progetto>' in module documentation.
