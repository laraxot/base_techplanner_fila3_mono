# Notification Channels

**When** you are implementing or modifying notification systems in the application

**Then** ensure that notifications support multiple channels such as Email (via `SpatieEmail` with database templates), SMS (configured for various providers), and Telegram (with support for messages, media, and interactive buttons). Always set the recipient explicitly in `toMail()` when using `SpatieEmail`.

**Because** this provides a flexible and robust notification system that can adapt to different communication needs and ensures that emails are correctly addressed.

**Examples**

- Correct: `public function toMail($notifiable): SpatieEmail { $email = new SpatieEmail($this->record, $this->slug); $email->to($notifiable->routeNotificationFor('mail')); return $email; }`
- Incorrect: Relying on automatic recipient setting in `SpatieEmail` without explicit `to()` call.
