# State Management

**When** you are implementing state management for models, such as registration states for `Doctor`

**Then** use `spatie/laravel-model-states` for managing model states instead of custom workflows, defining states as classes with specific transitions.

**Because** this provides strong typing, integrated validation, extensibility, query builder support, and automatic events for state changes.

**Examples**

- Correct: Define states like `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, and `Active` as classes extending `State` with configured transitions.
- Incorrect: Using a custom table or relation for state management without leveraging `spatie/laravel-model-states`.
