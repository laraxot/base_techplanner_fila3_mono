# Business Logic Actions

**When** you are implementing business logic or actions that need to be asynchronous or reusable

**Then** always use `spatie/laravel-queueable-action` for implementing queueable actions instead of traditional services.

**Because** this promotes reuse, testability, and ensures that actions can be queued for better performance and scalability.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use `spatie/laravel-queueable-action` to create actions like `RecordNotificationAction`.
- Incorrect: Implement business logic in traditional service classes that cannot be queued.
