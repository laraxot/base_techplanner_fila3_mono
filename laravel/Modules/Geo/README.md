## Overview

The Geo module is a central repository for all geographical data and functionality within the application. It provides a consistent way to manage locations, addresses, and geographical hierarchies across all modules.

## Features

- **Geographical Hierarchy Management**: Handle regions, provinces, cities, and postal codes (CAPs)
- **Address Management**: Store and manage complete address information
- **Reusable Address Components**: AddressesField component for DRY address management
- **Location Services**: Work with geographical coordinates and points of interest
- **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth for all geographical data
- **API Ready**: Easily expose geographical data through APIs

## Installation

1. Install the package via Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require laraxot/module_geo_fila3
   ```

2. Publish and run the migrations:

   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag="module_geo_fila3-migrations"
   php artisan migrate
   ```

3. (Optional) Publish the configuration file:

   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag="module_geo_fila3-config"
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```php
use Modules\Geo\Models\Region;
use Modules\Geo\Models\Province;
use Modules\Geo\Models\City;
use Modules\Geo\Models\Cap;

// Get all regions with their provinces
$regions = Region::with('provinces')->get();

// Get all cities in a province
$province = Province::find(1);
$cities = $province->cities;

// Get CAPs for a city
$city = City::find(1);
$caps = $city->caps;
```

### AddressesField Component

The Geo module provides a reusable `AddressesField` component for managing multiple addresses in Filament forms:

```php
use Modules\Geo\Filament\Forms\Components\AddressesField;

// Basic usage in a Filament Resource
AddressesField::make('addresses')
    ->relationship('addresses')
    ->minItems(1)
    ->addActionLabel('Add Address')
    ->columnSpanFull()

// Advanced configuration
AddressesField::make('addresses')
    ->relationship('addresses')
    ->minItems(1)
    ->maxItems(5)
    ->reorderable(true)
    ->managePrimary(true)
    ->addActionLabel('Add Location')
```

**Features:**
- **Multiple Addresses**: Manage collections of addresses with repeater
- **Conditional Visibility**: Name field appears only with multiple addresses
- **Primary Address Logic**: Automatic exclusive primary address management
- **Complete Italian Schema**: Full cascade selection (Region → Province → City → CAP)
- **Configurable**: Flexible API for different use cases
```

### Relationships

- **Region** has many **Provinces**
- **Province** belongs to a **Region** and has many **Cities**
- **City** belongs to a **Province** and has many **CAPs**
- **Cap** belongs to a **City**
