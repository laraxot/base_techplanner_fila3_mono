# TeamContract Usage Reasoning

## Overview
This document explains the rationale behind using `TeamContract` instead of `Team` in the `HasTeams` trait within the User module. The purpose is to ensure that the codebase adheres to best practices for dependency management and future-proofing.

## Reasoning for Using TeamContract

1. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: By referencing `TeamContract` (likely an interface or abstract class), the `HasTeams` trait is not tightly coupled to a specific `Team` class implementation. This allows for multiple implementations of team functionality without requiring changes to the trait itself.

2. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Using an interface or contract enables the system to support different team models or structures in the future. For instance, if a new type of team entity is introduced, as long as it implements `TeamContract`, the `HasTeams` trait will work seamlessly with it.

3. **Testing and Mocking**: During unit testing, it's easier to mock or stub an interface (`TeamContract`) than a concrete class (`Team`). This improves the testability of components that rely on team-related functionality.

4. **Consistency Across Modules**: Following this pattern ensures consistency across different modules or components that interact with team entities, promoting a unified approach to dependency management in the project.

## Implications
- **Code Changes**: All references to `Team` in method signatures, type hints, and docblocks within the `HasTeams` trait should be updated to `TeamContract` where applicable.
- **Documentation**: This change should be reflected in related documentation to maintain clarity for developers working on or with this trait.

## Conclusion
The shift to using `TeamContract` over `Team` in the `HasTeams` trait aligns with software engineering best practices, enhancing the flexibility, maintainability, and testability of the codebase. This approach prepares the system for future expansions or modifications to team-related functionalities without necessitating significant refactoring.
