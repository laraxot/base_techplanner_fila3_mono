# Maintenance Guidelines

**When** you are maintaining the application post-deployment

**Then** implement error tracking, monitor performance metrics, set up security alerts, and track usage statistics. Regularly update security patches, dependencies, features, and bug fixes.

**Because** this ensures the application remains secure, performs optimally, and continues to meet user needs over time.

**Examples**

- Correct: Set up Sentry for error tracking and schedule regular dependency updates.
- Incorrect: Ignore performance issues or delay security updates.
