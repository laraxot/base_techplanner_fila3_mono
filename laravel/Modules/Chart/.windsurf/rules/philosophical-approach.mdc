# Philosophical Approach

**When**: Defining the guiding principles or vision for the application's development.

**Then**:
- Adopt a philosophy of user-centric design and continuous improvement.
- Balance functionality with ethical considerations.
- Encourage a mindset of innovation and adaptability among the team.

**Because**:
- Aligns development with core values and long-term goals.
- Promotes a cohesive vision that guides decision-making.
- Inspires team members to think beyond immediate tasks.

**Examples**:

*Correct*:
- Prioritize features based on user needs and feedback.
- Regularly revisit the project's mission to ensure alignment.

*Incorrect*:
- Developing features without considering user impact.
- Sticking rigidly to initial plans despite changing needs.
