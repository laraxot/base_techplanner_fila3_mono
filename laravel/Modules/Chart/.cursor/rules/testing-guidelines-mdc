# Testing Guidelines

**When** you are writing or updating code in the application

**Then** create unit and feature tests for each model, service, controller, form, policy, and middleware. Ensure a minimum coverage of 80%. Place tests in `tests/Unit/` and `tests/Feature/` directories.

**Because** this ensures code reliability, prevents regressions, and maintains high quality standards across the application.

**Examples**

- Correct: Write tests for a new controller in `tests/Feature/Controllers/` with descriptive names like `UserControllerTest.php`.
- Incorrect: Skip writing tests or place them in non-standard directories.
