# Support Guidelines

**When** you are providing support for the application

**Then** offer support through email, ticket systems, chat, and phone. Ensure response times are under 2 hours, resolution times under 24 hours, maintain uptime over 99.9%, and backup restore times under 4 hours.

**Because** this ensures user satisfaction, quick issue resolution, and maintains trust in the application's reliability.

**Examples**

- Correct: Respond to a support ticket within 2 hours and resolve the issue within 24 hours.
- Incorrect: Delay responses or fail to meet uptime and restore time SLAs.
