# Modular Monolith Guidelines for Laravel

## Overview
This document outlines the best practices for structuring a Laravel application as a modular monolith. This approach combines the simplicity of monolithic architecture with the scalability and organization of microservices.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Modular Monolith?
A modular monolith is a single application with strictly defined internal modules. Each module owns its domain, exposes minimal interfaces, and hides its internal logic from the rest. This ensures clean separation and future readiness, similar to microservices without the distributed complexity.

### Common Pitfalls in Laravel Monoliths
- Giant controllers
- Bloated service classes
- Cross-module spaghetti logic
- Painful refactors

These issues arise from a lack of structure rather than poor coding practices.

### Structuring a Modular Monolith
- **Modules**: Each module acts like a mini-application with its own domain, application logic, infrastructure, and UI.
- **Domain**: Contains pure business logic.
- **Application**: Handles use cases.
- **Infrastructure**: Manages database access.
- **UI**: Provides HTTP entry points.

### Golden Rules of Modularity
- Each module has a clear purpose (e.g., Billing, Orders, Users).
- Modules hide their internals and expose services or events for external use.
- Modules depend on abstractions, not on other modules' internals.

### Organize by Feature, Not Type
Instead of organizing by controllers/models, organize by feature (e.g., Payments, Users, Subscriptions).

### Shared Kernel
Use shared logic sparingly and keep it tiny, stable, and abstract. Avoid turning it into a catch-all for miscellaneous code.

### Events Over Static Calls
Favor events over static calls to encourage decoupling and testability.

### Testing
Modular architecture allows for testing domain and use case logic in isolation, without Laravel bootstrapping.

### Gradual Transition
Start by isolating one domain, such as Users, and gradually move logic into domain/application layers.

## Conclusion
Adopting a modular monolith architecture in Laravel enhances maintainability, scalability, and clarity of your application structure. This approach provides a strategic path to evolve your application without the overhead of microservices.
