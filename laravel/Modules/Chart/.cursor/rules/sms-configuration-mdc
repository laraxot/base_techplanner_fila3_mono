# SMS Configuration

**When** you are configuring or modifying SMS settings in the application

**Then** always retrieve configurations from `config('sms')` for global settings and `config('sms.drivers.{provider}')` for provider-specific settings, avoiding duplication of settings like retry or rate limits in provider configurations.

**Because** this ensures consistency, modularity, and maintainability by centralizing SMS configurations in a dedicated file.

**Examples**

- Correct: `$token = config('sms.drivers.netfun.token');`
- Incorrect: `$token = config('services.netfun.token');`
