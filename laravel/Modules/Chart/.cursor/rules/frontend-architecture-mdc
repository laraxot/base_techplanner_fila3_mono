# Frontend Architecture

**When** you are working on the frontend of the application

**Then** use Folio, Volt, Livewire, and Widgets for Frontoffice. Do not define routes in `web.php`. Place templates in `Themes/{Theme}/resources/views/pages/`. Ensure Widgets extend `XotBaseWidget` with `HasForms`. Avoid directly extending Filament classes.

**Because** this maintains a consistent frontend structure, leverages Filament's capabilities, and ensures modularity and reusability.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use Folio and Volt for page rendering with templates in the specified theme directory.
- Incorrect: Define custom routes in `web.php` or directly extend Filament classes for widgets.
