# Filosofia Guidelines (Philosophical Considerations)

**When** you are conceptualizing or architecting solutions for the project

**Then** reflect on the broader purpose and long-term impact of your design decisions, considering how they align with the project's core values and vision.

**Because** this ensures that the project remains grounded in a meaningful direction, fostering sustainable and thoughtful development.

**Examples**

- Correct: Design systems that prioritize user empowerment and long-term usability.
- Incorrect: Focus solely on immediate technical requirements without considering the project's mission.
