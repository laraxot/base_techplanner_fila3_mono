# Performance Optimization Guidelines

**When** you are developing or optimizing the application for performance

**Then** implement lazy loading, optimize assets, use browser and server caching, leverage a CDN for assets, optimize database queries, use queues for jobs, and apply rate limiting where necessary.

**Because** this improves application speed, reduces server load, and enhances user experience.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use lazy loading for images and implement query optimization for database calls.
- Incorrect: Load all assets upfront or run unoptimized queries that slow down the application.
