# Zen Guidelines (Zen Principles in Development)

**When** you are approaching problem-solving or development tasks

**Then** embrace simplicity, focus on the present task, and cultivate a mindful approach to coding, avoiding overthinking or unnecessary stress.

**Because** this promotes clarity, reduces burnout, and leads to more effective and maintainable solutions.

**Examples**

- Correct: Focus on solving one issue at a time with a clear mind.
- Incorrect: Multitask excessively, leading to scattered focus and incomplete solutions.
