# Volt and Folio Guidelines

**When** you are working with Volt and Folio for frontend development

**Then** ensure the `@volt` directive is always the first thing in the Folio file, do not use `@volt` within HTML markup, and always use the correct layouts such as `<x-layouts.app>` or `<x-layouts.guest>`. Avoid using non-existent layouts.

**Because** this ensures proper rendering and structure of pages, maintaining consistency and preventing runtime errors.

**Examples**

- Correct: Start a Folio file with `@volt` directive followed by proper layout usage.
- Incorrect: Place `@volt` within HTML or use invalid layouts.
