# Translation Management

**When** you are adding or modifying text in Filament components or any user-facing elements

**Then** do not use the `->label()` method for setting text. Instead, manage translations through language files located in `Modules/<ModuleName>/lang/<locale>`.

**Because** this approach ensures that translations are centralized, easily maintainable, and automatically handled by the `LangServiceProvider`, promoting consistency across the application.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use translation keys in language files like `module::resource.fields.name.label`
- Incorrect: `Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->label('Name')`
