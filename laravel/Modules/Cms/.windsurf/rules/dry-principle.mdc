# DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**When** you are writing or modifying code or documentation

**Then** avoid duplication by reusing existing code, components, or documentation through abstraction and modularization.

**Because** this reduces maintenance overhead, minimizes errors, and improves code readability and scalability.

**Examples**

- Correct: Create a reusable function or component to handle repeated logic.
- Incorrect: Copy-pasting the same code block in multiple places.

**See**:
- [Code Quality Guidelines](../Modules/Xot/docs/CODE_QUALITY.md)
