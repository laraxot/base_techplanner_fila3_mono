# Routing and Controller Guidelines

**When** you are defining routes and controllers in the application

**Then** place routes in `routes/web.php` with prefixes like `/{locale}/admin` for admin routes. Ensure controllers are named with the suffix `Controller` and are located in `app/Http/Controllers/`.

**Because** this maintains a clear structure for routing and controller logic, making the application easier to navigate and maintain.

**Examples**

- Correct: Define admin routes as `/{locale}/admin/dashboard` in `routes/web.php`.
- Incorrect: Scatter routes across different files or omit the `Controller` suffix in controller names.
