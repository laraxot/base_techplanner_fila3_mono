# Localization Guidelines

**When** you are implementing localization features in the application

**Then** use `mcamara/laravel-localization` with methods like `LaravelLocalization::getCurrentLocale()` and `getSupportedLocales()`. Ensure URLs include a language prefix like `/{locale}/{sezione}/{risorsa}`.

**Because** this provides a robust framework for managing multiple languages and ensures users can navigate the application in their preferred language.

**Examples**

- Correct: Structure URLs as `/it/pages/chi-siamo` with proper locale prefix.
- Incorrect: Omit locale prefix in URLs like `/pages/chi-siamo`.
