# Blade Components

**When** you are creating or modifying Blade components for the user interface

**Then** always prefer native Filament Blade components over custom ones, using the `<x-filament::...>` syntax.

**Because** this ensures reuse, testability, accessibility, and consistency in UI/UX across the application.

**Examples**

- Correct: `<x-filament::button>Click Me</x-filament::button>`
- Incorrect: Creating a custom Blade component for a button when a Filament component exists.
