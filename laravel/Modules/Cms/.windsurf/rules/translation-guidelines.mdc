# Translation Guidelines

**When** you are adding or modifying text in Filament components or any user-facing elements

**Then** use translations located in `lang/{locale}` directories, following the naming convention `modulo::risorsa.fields.campo.label` for keys.

**Because** this ensures centralized management of translations, making the application consistent and maintainable across different languages.

**Examples**

- Correct: Use keys like `module::resource.fields.name.label` in language files.
- Incorrect: Hardcode text or use `->label()` method directly in components.

**See**:
- [Localization Documentation](../Modules/Xot/docs/LOCALIZATION.md)
