# Database Migration Guidelines

**When** you are creating or modifying database structures

**Then** use Laravel migrations to define schema changes. Place migration files in `database/migrations/` and ensure they are descriptive, following the naming convention `YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_create_table_name_table.php` or similar.

**Because** this ensures version control for database schema changes, making it easier to track and rollback changes if needed.

**Examples**

- Correct: Name a migration file `2023_05_16_143022_create_users_table.php` for creating a users table.
- Incorrect: Use generic names like `migration1.php` or place migrations outside the designated folder.
