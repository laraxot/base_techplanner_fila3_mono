# Agile Methodology

**When** you are planning or executing development tasks in the project

**Then** adopt an iterative approach with frequent feedback loops, prioritizing working software over comprehensive documentation, and adapting to changing requirements.

**Because** this promotes flexibility, faster delivery of value, and better alignment with user needs.

**Examples**

- Correct: Break tasks into small, manageable sprints with regular reviews.
- Incorrect: Follow a rigid, waterfall approach without room for adjustments.
