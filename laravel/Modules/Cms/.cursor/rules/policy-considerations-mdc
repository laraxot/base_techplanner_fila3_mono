# Policy Considerations

**When**: Designing features or making decisions that impact user interaction or data handling in the application.

**Then**:
- Consider the policy implications of features, especially regarding data privacy and user rights.
- Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards (e.g., GDPR).
- Document policy decisions and their rationale for transparency.

**Because**:
- Protects users and the organization from legal and ethical issues.
- Builds trust with users by prioritizing their rights and privacy.
- Provides a clear framework for decision-making.

**Examples**:

*Correct*:
- Implement opt-in consent for data collection.
- Document data handling policies in user agreements.

*Incorrect*:
- Collecting user data without explicit consent.
- Ignoring regional data protection laws.
