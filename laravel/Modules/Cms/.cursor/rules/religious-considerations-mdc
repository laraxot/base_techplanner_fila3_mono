# Religious Considerations

**When**: Designing features or content that may impact diverse user groups in the application.

**Then**:
- Be mindful of religious sensitivities and cultural differences.
- Avoid content or features that could be perceived as disrespectful or exclusionary.
- Provide options for customization where religious practices may influence usage.

**Because**:
- Ensures inclusivity and respect for all users.
- Prevents alienation or offense to specific user groups.
- Enhances the application's appeal to a global audience.

**Examples**:

*Correct*:
- Offer calendar options that include various religious holidays.
- Avoid imagery or language that could be religiously insensitive.

*Incorrect*:
- Using religious symbols inappropriately in UI design.
- Ignoring religious diversity in content creation.
