# Politica Guidelines (Policy Considerations)

**When** you are making decisions or designing systems that impact users or stakeholders

**Then** consider the ethical, legal, and social implications of your choices, ensuring alignment with organizational policies and cultural norms.

**Because** this helps maintain trust, compliance, and social responsibility within the project ecosystem.

**Examples**

- Correct: Design features with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) in mind.
- Incorrect: Ignore regulatory requirements when implementing user data handling.
