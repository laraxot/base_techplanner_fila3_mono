# Git Conflict Analysis - TechPlanner Filament Monorepo

## Overview

Analyzed 271 files containing Git conflict markers (`=======`) throughout the Laravel monolithic application with modular structure.

## Project Structure

This is a Laravel-based monolithic application using Filament Admin Panel with multiple modules:

### Core Modules
- **TechPlanner**: Main business logic module for technical service planning
- **Employee**: Employee management and work hour tracking  
- **Geo**: Geographic data management and addressing
- **User**: User authentication and management
- **Media**: File and media management
- **Notify**: Notification and communication system
- **UI**: User interface components and themes
- **Lang**: Multi-language support
- **Tenant**: Multi-tenancy support

### Themes
- **Sixteen**: Modern Tailwind-based theme
- **Two**: Alternative theme implementation

## Conflict Patterns Identified

### 1. Nested Double Conflicts
Common pattern in test files and configuration:
```php
=======
// use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
```

### 2. Empty Line Conflicts
Simple conflicts where only line endings or spacing differs.

### 3. Import Statement Conflicts
Common in PHP files with use statements.

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Most conflicts appear to be formatting, imports, or minor code differences
- **Medium Risk**: Configuration files and service providers need careful review
- **High Risk**: Database migrations and core model files require manual inspection

## Resolution Strategy

1. **Automated Resolution**: Simple formatting and import conflicts
2. **Manual Review**: Core business logic, migrations, and configuration
3. **Testing**: All resolved files must be tested for functionality

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive backup
2. Resolve conflicts systematically by module
3. Run tests after each module resolution
4. Update documentation for resolved conflicts
